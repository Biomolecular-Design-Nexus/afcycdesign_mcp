# Cyclic Peptide Structure Prediction from Sequence
# Mode: Structure prediction for a given sequence with head-to-tail cyclization
# Use case: Predict 3D structure of a known cyclic peptide sequence

name: "cyclosporin_like_8mer"
description: "Predict structure for cyclic peptide sequence RVKDGYPF with head-to-tail cyclization"

# Peptide specification - provide sequence for structure prediction
peptide:
  # Sequence to predict structure for (required for sequence mode)
  # Only natural amino acids: ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY
  sequence: "RVKDGYPF"

  # Length is automatically determined from sequence
  # length: 8  # Optional, will be inferred from sequence

# Structure constraints for cyclic peptide
constraints:
  add_rg: false                # Radius of gyration constraint, suggested to set true only for longer peptides (>10 residues)
  rg_weight: 0.1
  offset_type: 2               # Cyclic offset type for head-to-tail cyclization

# Optimization parameters
optimization:
  num_recycles: 1              # More recycles for better structure quality
  soft_iters: 50               # Soft optimization iterations
  hard_iters: 50               # Hard optimization to refine sequence-structure match
  stage_iters: [50, 50, 10]    # 3-stage refinement

# Loss function weights
loss_weights:
  pae: 1.0                     # Predicted Aligned Error
  plddt: 1.0                   # Confidence score
